My homepage created for CS50

This website was created by me while I was working through the OpenCourseWare of CS50 (Introduction to Computer Science) at Harvard University.
In Week 8, the Problem Set was to create a personal homepage using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap only. You can read about the complete specifications here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/8/homepage/
